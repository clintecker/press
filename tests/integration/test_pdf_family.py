"""Real-tool integration runner: the PDF reading edition.

Builds a source-only factory book to ``dist/<slug>.pdf`` with the actual
pandoc -> LuaLaTeX -> latexmk toolchain, then inspects it with the real
``verify_pdf`` verifier (Poppler's pdfinfo/pdffonts/pdftotext/pdftoppm).
No fake process, no mock verifier, no network. When any tool is absent
the runner skips naming the toolchain capability, so a missing tool is
never read as an artifact failure. The cover-wrap runner proves the
print-profile interior, so it is not rebuilt here.
